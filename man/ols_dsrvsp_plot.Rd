\title{Deleted Studentized Residual vs Fitted Values Plot}
\usage{
ols_dsrvsp_plot(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of class \code{lm}}
}
\value{
\code{ols_dsrvsp_plot} returns  a list containing the
following components:

\item{outliers}{a tibble with observation number, fitted values and deleted studentized 
residuals that exceed the \code{threshold} for classifying observations as 
outliers/influential observations}
\item{threshold}{\code{threshold} for classifying an observation as an outlier/influential observation}
}
\description{
Plot for detecting violation of assumptions about residuals
such as non-linearity, constant variances and outliers. It can also be used to examine model fit.
}
\details{
Studentized deleted residuals (or externally studentized residuals) is the deleted residual 
divided by its estimated standard deviation. Studentized residuals are going to be more effective for 
detecting outlying Y observations than standardized residuals. If an observation has an externally 
studentized residual that is larger than 2 (in absolute value) we can call it an outlier.
