\title{Studentized residual plot}
\usage{
ols_plot_resid_stud(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \code{lm}.}
}
\value{
\code{ols_plot_resid_stud} returns  a list containing the
following components:

\item{outliers}{a tibble with observation number and \code{studentized residuals} that
exceed \code{threshold}} for classifying an observation as an outlier
\item{threshold}{\code{threshold} for classifying an observation as an outlier}
}
\description{
Graph for identifying outliers.
}
\details{
Studentized deleted residuals (or externally studentized residuals) is the
deleted residual divided by its estimated standard deviation. Studentized
residuals are going to be more effective for detecting outlying Y
observations than standardized residuals. If an observation has an externally
studentized residual that is larger than 3 (in absolute value) we can call
it an outlier.
