\title{Actual vs Fitted Values Plot}
\usage{
ols_ovsp_plot(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of class \code{lm}}
}
\description{
Plot of actual vs fitted values to assess the fit of the model.
}
\details{
Ideally, all your points should be close to a regressed diagonal line. Draw such a diagonal line 
within your graph and check out where the points lie. If your model had a high R Square, all the points would 
be close to this diagonal line. The lower the R Square, the weaker the Goodness of fit of your model, the more 
foggy or dispersed your points are from this diagonal line.

\examples{
model <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + wt, data = mtcars)
