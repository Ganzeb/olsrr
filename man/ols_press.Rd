\title{PRESS (Prediction Sum of Squares)}
\usage{
ols_press(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of class \code{lm}}
}
\value{
Predicted Sum of Squares
}
\description{
PRESS tells you how well the model will predict new data.
}
\details{
The prediction sum of squares (PRESS) is the sum of squares of the prediction error. Each fitted 
value for PRESS is obtained from the remaining n â€“ 1 observations, then using the fitted regression function 
to obtain the predicted value for the ith observation. Use PRESS to assess your model's predictive ability. 
Usually, the smaller the PRESS value, the better the model's predictive ability.
