\title{Studentized Residual Plot}
\usage{
ols_srsd_plot(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{an object of class \code{lm}}
}
\value{
\code{ols_srsd_plot} returns  a list containing the
following components:

\item{outliers}{a tibble with observation number and \code{studentized residuals} that 
exceed \code{threshold}} for classifying an observation as an outlier
\item{threshold}{\code{threshold} for classifying an observation as an outlier}
}
\description{
Graph for identifying outliers
}
\details{
Studentized deleted residuals (or externally studentized residuals) is the deleted residual 
divided by its estimated standard deviation. Studentized residuals are going to be more effective for 
detecting outlying Y observations than standardized residuals. If an observation has an externally 
studentized residual that is larger than 3 (in absolute value) we can call it an outlier.
